# Hogwarts legacy

It's fine. But it's really not great either, and once the story was done I put the game down and never looked back.

# Persona 5 Royal

It's really good, but I didn't get to actually finish it yet because it's also really really long.

# Final Fantasy XIV

It's really good, but it's also really really large. Ain't nobody got time for MMOs.

# Baldur's Gate 3

It's great. Long, sprawling, fun. And horny.

# Lies of P

It's a solid souls like. The theme is interesting, and gameplay is great.

# Elden Ring

I will always come back to this, and it is a master piece.
